# UFOs

## Overview of the project
The overview of the project was to build a website with a dynamic table, that had additional filters added to it to allow users to search by different criteria. 

## Results

The below images shows the created website with the table of the UFO sighting without the additional filters.

This image shows the added filters, where users were allowed to filter by multiple criteria at the same time. It also allowed the users to filter by specific filters for faster results based on a user’s interest.

For example, this table was filtered by:

•	state: ca 

•	country: us

•	shape: light

## Summary

One drawback of the design is that the filters are very specific and they must be entered as they are in the table, otherwise they wont work. 

Two recommendations:

•	Add dropdown menu instead of an input field, which users can pick from.

•	Adding a clear filters at the bottom of the search criteria.
